# **Papers Reading List.**
- This is a collection of papers aiming at reducing model sizes or the ASIC/FPGA accelerator for Machine Learning, expecially deep neural network related applications. (Inspiled by [Neural-Networks-on-Silicon](https://github.com/fengbintu/Neural-Networks-on-Silicon/blob/master/README.md))
- Notes can be found in my personal [blog](https://zhishengwang.github.io/Neural-Network-Notes/). (**TODO**)
